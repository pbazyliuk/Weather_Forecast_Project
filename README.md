“Weather Forecast” – is a simple weather forecast app, 
powered by free OpenWeatherMap APIs and the browser’s built in geolocation capabilities. 
However, starting with Chrome 50, Chrome no longer supports obtaining the user's location
using the HTML5 Geolocation API from pages delivered by non-secure connections. 
Fortunately, Firefox browser doesn’t have such limitations.

“Weather Forecast” app provides general weather forecast for 5 or 10 days, 
detailed weather forecast for 5 days with data every 3 hours, 
and temperature bar chart. This app also supports responsive design.
